    <p>Charlotte Chorot-Bernard. Chasing a dream.  After a journey in graphics, magazine writing, marketing, research, strategic planning and website development, the COVID-19 pandemic catapulted me in search of what I really want to do, journalism, broadcasting the latest news, business and tackling the political jungle.  Its my passion but I don't want to just report it, I want my audience to really feel and understand the story-relive it so to speak. 
      <br><br/>
      
    I would like to create a world in my oculus quest 2 using the skills I obtain from this class.</p>
    <br>
      Here is my bullet list.
      
    
    <ul>
      <li>find a venue to shoot in panarama mode</li>
      <li>use my Iphone camera</li>
      <li>create a 3D footage to download in VR</li>
    </ul>
